      "thesis": "Most entrepreneurial community optimize for visibility.\nWe optimize for thinking before building.",
      "p1": "Entrepreneurship is usually discussed in rooms that demand confidence — designed for pitching, networking, or personal branding.",
      "p2": "But the most consequential moments happen earlier: when ideas are still fragile, trade-offs unclear, and the right path undecided.",

      "title": "What a Jam feels like?",
      "p1": "You arrive with a drink— not a pitch.\nConversations start loosely, then sharpen around what matters.",
      "p2": "Most Jams center around an experienced builder, a founder actively building a new product or solution, or sometimes an expert invited to walk us through a specific question or problem.",
      "p3": "We think and learn together. You leave, not with a playbook, but with better questions, clearer instincts, and the quiet confidence that you’re not thinking alone."
